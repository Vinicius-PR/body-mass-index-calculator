# Frontend Mentor - Body Mass Index Calculator

![Design preview for the Body Mass Index Calculator coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

this challenge is to build out this body mass index calculator page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Expected behaviour

Below you will find the BMI ranges and their weight classifications. Based on the person's BMI results, add their weight classification onto sentence "Your BMI suggests you‚Äôre" within the results component.

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI 30 or greater

Add the individual's healthy weight range based on the lower and upper BMI categorisations and the person's height.

## Building your project

For this project was a simple one. Didn't need a framework or library like Angular or React.

**Technologies used**:

- HTML5
- SCSS
- JavaScript

The most difficult part was to calculate the BMI and to use CSS Grid on footer.

## What I leaned?

I learned more about CSS Grid. We usually use more flex-box on our projects. However, on this project I had to use the grid on footer. According to Design, flex-box would not help much.

Also, I learned more about two methods of html elements. The  _.textContent_ and _.innerHTML_. Both look similar but is used for different purpose.
The _.textContent_ I used to change the content inside the element. The _.innerHTML_ I used to insert not just text or content, but also tags.

## See the app running

Below the description you can see the link of the app running. Hope your BMI result is good. üòÅ
